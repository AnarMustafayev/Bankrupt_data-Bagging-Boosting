This repository contains code for a machine learning project that focuses on implementing bagging and boosting algorithms to address an imbalance problem in the target column. The project utilizes oversampling techniques to balance the distribution of classes in the dataset. The oversampling and ensemble techniques significantly improve the model's ability to handle class imbalance, leading to better predictive performance.
Oversampling Strategie - Random Oversampling, 
Bagging Algorithm - Bagged Decision Trees, 
Boosting Algorithm - XGBBoost.
